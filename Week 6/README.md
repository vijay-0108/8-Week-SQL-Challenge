-- 2. How many times was each product added to cart?
-- 3. How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
-- 4. How many times was each product purchased?

## C. Before & After Analysis

### This technique is usually used when we inspect an important event and want to inspect the impact before and after a certain point in time.
-- Taking the `week_date` value of `2020-06-15` as the baseline week where the Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect. We would include all `week_date` values for `2020-06-15` as the start of the period after the change and the previous week_date values would be before. Using this analysis approach - answer the following questions:

### Question 1
### 1. What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?
```` SQL
CREATE VIEW new_te AS
WITH after_sales AS (
    SELECT SUM(sales) AS total_after_sales
    FROM (
        SELECT sales, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY week_date_new) AS ranking
        FROM clean_weekly_sales
        WHERE week_date_new >= '2020-06-15'
    ) ranked
    WHERE ranking <= 4
), 
before_sales AS (
    SELECT SUM(sales) AS total_before_sales
    FROM (
        SELECT sales, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY week_date_new DESC) AS ranking
        FROM clean_weekly_sales
        WHERE week_date_new < '2020-06-15'
    ) ranked
    WHERE ranking <= 4
)
SELECT total_after_sales, total_before_sales
FROM after_sales, before_sales;

SELECT total_after_sales - total_before_sales AS sales_variance,
       ROUND((total_before_sales / (total_before_sales + total_after_sales)) * 100, 2) -
       ROUND((total_after_sales / (total_before_sales + total_after_sales)) * 100, 2) AS percent_variance
FROM new_te;

### Question 2
### 2. What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?

```` SQL
CREATE VIEW new_tep_tab AS
WITH after_sales AS (
    SELECT SUM(sales) AS total_after_sales
    FROM (
        SELECT sales, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY week_date_new) AS ranking

        WHERE week_date_new >= '2020-06-15'

before_sales AS (
    SELECT SUM(sales) AS total_before_sales
    FROM (
        SELECT sales, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY week_date_new DESC) AS ranking
        FROM clean_weekly_sales
        WHERE week_date_new < '2020-06-15'
    ) ranked
    WHERE ranking <= 12
)
SELECT total_after_sales, total_before_sales
FROM after_sales, before_sales;

SELECT total_after_sales - total_before_sales AS sales_variance,
       ROUND((total_before_sales / (total_before_sales + total_after_sales)) * 100, 2) -
       ROUND((total_after_sales / (total_before_sales + total_after_sales)) * 100, 2) AS percent_variance
