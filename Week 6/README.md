## c. Product Funnel Analysis

### Question 1
### Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:
-- 1. How many times was each product viewed?
-- 2. How many times was each product added to cart?
-- 3. How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
-- 4. How many times was each product purchased?

```` SQL
with x as(
select visit_id , cookie_id , page_id ,  page_name , product_category , event_type , event_name , sequence_number , event_time , max(page_id) over(partition by visit_id) as max_page_id
from events left join event_identifier using(event_type)
left join page_hierarchy using(page_id)) , 
y as(
select visit_id , cookie_id , page_id ,  page_name , product_category , event_type , event_name , sequence_number , event_time ,
 case when max_page_id='13' then 'items_purchased'
	else 'items_not_purchased'
	end as purchase_category
from x)
select page_name , 
	count(case when event_name = 'page view' then 1 end) as page_view_count , 
    count(case when event_name = 'add to cart' then 1 end) as added_to_cart_count , 
    count(case when event_name = 'add to cart' and purchase_category = 'items_not_purchased' then 1 end) as added_to_cart_not_purchased,
    count(case when event_name = 'add to cart' and purchase_category = 'items_purchased' then page_id  end) as added_to_cart_purchased
from y
where page_name not in ('home page' , 'all products' , 'checkout' , 'confirmation')
group by page_name;

### Additionally, create another table which further aggregates the data for the above points but this time for each product category instead of individual products.

```` SQL
with x as(
select visit_id , cookie_id , page_id ,  page_name , product_category , event_type , event_name , sequence_number , event_time , max(page_id) over(partition by visit_id) as max_page_id
from events left join event_identifier using(event_type)
left join page_hierarchy using(page_id)) , 
y as(
select visit_id , cookie_id , page_id ,  page_name , product_category , event_type , event_name , sequence_number , event_time ,
 case when max_page_id='13' then 'items_purchased'
	else 'items_not_purchased'
	end as purchase_category
from x)
select product_category , 
	count(case when event_name = 'page view' then 1 end) as page_view_count , 
    count(case when event_name = 'add to cart' then 1 end) as added_to_cart_count , 
    count(case when event_name = 'add to cart' and purchase_category = 'items_not_purchased' then 1 end) as added_to_cart_not_purchased,
    count(case when event_name = 'add to cart' and purchase_category = 'items_purchased' then page_id  end) as added_to_cart_purchased
from y
where page_name not in ('home page' , 'all products' , 'checkout' , 'confirmation')
group by product_category;

## D. Campaigns Analysis

### Question 1
### Generate a table that has 1 single row for every unique visit_id record and has the following columns:
- `user_id`
- `visit_id`
- `visit_start_time`: the earliest event_time for each visit
- `page_views`: count of page views for each visit
- `cart_adds`: count of product cart add events for each visit
- `purchase`: 1/0 flag if a purchase event exists for each visit
- `campaign_name`: map the visit to a campaign if the visit_start_time falls between the start_date and end_date
- `impression`: count of ad impressions for each visit
- `click`: count of ad clicks for each visit
- (Optional column) `cart_products`: a comma separated text value with products added to the cart sorted by the order they were added to the cart (hint: use the sequence_number)
