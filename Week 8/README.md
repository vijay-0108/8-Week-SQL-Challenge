## üìå Challenge Overview  
This case study is part of the **[8-Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com)** by **Danny Ma**.  
Check out the original challenge details [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-8/).  
 
## üìù Introduction  
Danny created Fresh Segments, a digital marketing agency that helps other businesses analyse trends in online ad click behaviour for their unique customer base.

Clients share their customer lists with the Fresh Segments team who then aggregate interest metrics and generate a single dataset worth of metrics for further analysis.

In particular - the composition and rankings for different interests are provided for each client showing the proportion of their customer list who interacted with online assets related to each interest for each month.

Danny has asked for your assistance to analyse aggregated metrics for an example client and provide some high level insights about the customer list and their interests.

### Question 6
### 6. What sort of table join should we perform for our analysis and why? Check your logic by checking the rows where interest_id = 21246 in your joined output and include all columns from fresh_segments.interest_metrics and all columns from fresh_segments.interest_map except from the id column

### Question 7
### 7. Are there any records in your joined table where the month_year value is before the created_at value from the fresh_segments.interest_map table? Do you think these values are valid and why?

### Question 3
### 3. If we were to remove all interest_id values which are lower than the total_months value we found in the previous question - how many total data points would we be removing?

--- we can see a relationship between the no of pizza's in an order to the time taken to complete the order
```` SQL

````
### Answer

***

### Question 4
### 4. Does this decision make sense to remove these data points from a business perspective? Use an example where there are all 14 months present to a removed interest example for your arguments - think about what it means to have less months present from a segment perspective.

## C. Segment Analysis

### Question 1
### 1. Using our filtered dataset by removing the interests with less than 6 months worth of data, which are the top 10 and bottom 10 interests which have the largest composition values in any month_year? Only use the maximum composition value for each interest but you must keep the corresponding month_year

## D. Index Analysis

### The index_value is a measure which can be used to reverse calculate the average composition for Fresh Segments‚Äô clients.
### Average composition can be calculated by dividing the composition column by the index_value column rounded to 2 decimal places.

### Question 1
### 1. What is the top 10 interests by the average composition for each month?

```` SQL

````

### Question 5
### 5. Provide a possible reason why the max average composition might change from month to month? Could it signal something is not quite right with the overall business model for Fresh Segments?
