## üìå Challenge Overview  
This case study is part of the **[8-Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com)** by **Danny Ma**.  
Check out the original challenge details [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-5/).  
 
## üìù Introduction 
Data Mart is Danny‚Äôs latest venture and after running international operations for his online supermarket that specialises in fresh produce - Danny is asking for your support to analyse his sales performance.

In June 2020 - large scale supply changes were made at Data Mart. All Data Mart products now use sustainable packaging methods in every single step from the farm all the way to the customer.

Danny needs your help to quantify the impact of this change on the sales performance for Data Mart and it‚Äôs separate business areas.

The key business question he wants you to help him answer are the following:

What was the quantifiable impact of the changes introduced in June 2020?
Which platform, region, segment and customer types were the most impacted by this change?
What can we do about future introduction of similar sustainability updates to the business to minimise impact on sales?

## üìú Questions & Solutions  

## A. Data Cleansing Steps

### Question 1
### In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the `data_mart` schema named `clean_weekly_sales`:
- Convert the `week_date` to a `DATE` format
- Add a `week_number` as the second column for each `week_date` value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc
- Add a `month_number` with the calendar month for each `week_date` value as the 3rd column
- Add a `calendar_year` column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
- Add a new column called `age_band` after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value

- Add a new `demographic` column using the following mapping for the first letter in the `segment` values:  

| segment | demographic | 
| ------- | ----------- |
| C | Couples |
| F | Families |

- Ensure all `null` string values with an "unknown" string value in the original `segment` column as well as the new `age_band` and `demographic` columns
- Generate a new `avg_transaction` column as the sales value divided by transactions rounded to 2 decimal places for each record

## C. Before & After Analysis

### This technique is usually used when we inspect an important event and want to inspect the impact before and after a certain point in time.
-- Taking the `week_date` value of `2020-06-15` as the baseline week where the Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect. We would include all `week_date` values for `2020-06-15` as the start of the period after the change and the previous week_date values would be before. Using this analysis approach - answer the following questions:

### Question 1
### 1. What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?
```` SQL
CREATE VIEW new_te AS
WITH after_sales AS (
    SELECT SUM(sales) AS total_after_sales
    FROM (
        SELECT sales, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY week_date_new) AS ranking
        FROM clean_weekly_sales
        WHERE week_date_new >= '2020-06-15'
    ) ranked
    WHERE ranking <= 4
), 
before_sales AS (
    SELECT SUM(sales) AS total_before_sales
    FROM (
        SELECT sales, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY week_date_new DESC) AS ranking
        FROM clean_weekly_sales
        WHERE week_date_new < '2020-06-15'
    ) ranked
    WHERE ranking <= 4
)
SELECT total_after_sales, total_before_sales
FROM after_sales, before_sales;

SELECT total_after_sales - total_before_sales AS sales_variance,
       ROUND((total_before_sales / (total_before_sales + total_after_sales)) * 100, 2) -
       ROUND((total_after_sales / (total_before_sales + total_after_sales)) * 100, 2) AS percent_variance
FROM new_te;

### Question 2
### 2. What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?

```` SQL
CREATE VIEW new_tep_tab AS
WITH after_sales AS (
    SELECT SUM(sales) AS total_after_sales
    FROM (
        SELECT sales, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY week_date_new) AS ranking
        FROM clean_weekly_sales
        WHERE week_date_new >= '2020-06-15'
    ) ranked
    WHERE ranking <= 12
), 
before_sales AS (
    SELECT SUM(sales) AS total_before_sales
    FROM (
        SELECT sales, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY week_date_new DESC) AS ranking
        FROM clean_weekly_sales
        WHERE week_date_new < '2020-06-15'
    ) ranked
    WHERE ranking <= 12
)
SELECT total_after_sales, total_before_sales
FROM after_sales, before_sales;

SELECT total_after_sales - total_before_sales AS sales_variance,
       ROUND((total_before_sales / (total_before_sales + total_after_sales)) * 100, 2) -
       ROUND((total_after_sales / (total_before_sales + total_after_sales)) * 100, 2) AS percent_variance
FROM new_tep_tab;
